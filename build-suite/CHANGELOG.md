## [[Grunt Branch]](https://bitbucket.org/demandware/build-suite/src/4ad8e2001b5a4200422ced9844df545dd6f45ae5/?at=grunt) - 2015-02-27
- Merged new features in to grunt branch including support for svn and two factor auth.
- IMPORTANT: ALL properties files are being moved to json files to support more advanced configuration.  A merge option exists to merge the global properties files.  The project repository folders should be converted by hand if you use any advanced options.  A sample file is provided. 
- Known Issues: Two factor auth will successfully push the archive to the remote server.  It is a known issue that it will not unzip nor activate.  We are working on that.
