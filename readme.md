# Service Framework

------
This is a demo branch showcasing the capability of the Commerce Cloud Service Framework.
Check out ServiceDemo.js for the demo code using the service framework.

The Service Framework is great for the following:
* Implementing circuit breaker pattern
* Implementing rate limiter to protect external services from excessing access
* Separating code and credential information (let the business user take control of the credentials)
